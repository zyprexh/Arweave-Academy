### Frontend Challenge 1: File-based Routing

- **Decription**  
  Build a simple website with multiple HTML files that link to each other and deploy it on Arweave.
- **Why?**  
  This is the easiest way to build a website and fits Arweave’s permanent storage model, and AR.IO gateways can’t execute server-side code. Use it for very simple websites when additional tooling would create too much overhead.
- **Tools**  
  Dragondeploy, etc.
