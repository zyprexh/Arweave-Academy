## Overview

The School of DumDum is a part of Arweave Academy developer education program. We offer developers free, high-quality courses and practical tasks to help them start building applications on Arweave and AO from scratch.  

Special thanks to [@K4y1s](https://x.com/K4y1s), [@sayestheorem](https://x.com/sayestheorem), [@rosmcmahon_real](https://x.com/rosmcmahon_real) and [@developer_dao](https://x.com/developer_dao) for support, and to [@OpenBuildxyz](https://x.com/OpenBuildxyz) for their guidance and assistance with the event process.

We divided this event into two parts: one for beginners and one for advanced developers.

- **Beginners** can enter the `Learning section`, where they will complete their learning by studying courses and submitting tasks.
- **Advanced Developers** can directly participate in the `Practice section` competition. You can choose a topic of your interest from the challange list and complete the practice by developing and writing tutorials. The best practices will be selected by judges and rewarded.

## Preparation

Before participating in the event, here’s what you need to prepare:

- An Arweave/AO wallet -- [Arconnect](https://www.arconnect.io/)
- An all-in-one Arweave AO relevant documentation list -- [awesome-ao](https://github.com/ArweaveOasis/awesome-ao)
- Arweave block explorer -- [viewblock](https://viewblock.io/arweave)
- AO explorer -- [aolink](https://www.ao.link/)

## Registration

Developers need to complete GitHub registration by following these steps:

1. **Star**, **Watch** and **Fork** this repository and `git clone` it to your local machine. <br> 👉 Not familiar with Git/Github? Check out [Using Arweave Academy Github](./doc/Using%20Arweave%20Academy%20Github.md).
2. Navigate to the `submissions` folder and create a new folder named after your GitHub username, e.g. `submissions/YourName`.
3. Copy the [Template.md](./template.md) file into the newly created folder and rename it to your name: `YourName.md`.
4. Open the `submissions/YourName/YourName.md` file, fill in your information as instructed, and save it.
5. Commit your changes and create a Pull Request to this repository. Once your PR is merged, your GitHub registration is complete.
6. Once completed, you are welcome to join in the Arweave Academy [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/mmFjtTjxzf)!

## Task Submission

After each course there will be a series of tasks. These tasks will test whether you have mastered the course content. You will be redirected to the @OpenBuildxyz platform to complete the task and submit a screenshot of the result to your folder in the GitHub repository.

For example, to submit `task1`, follow these steps:

1. Create a `task1` folder under `submissions/YourName`.
2. Click [task1](https://openbuild.xyz/quiz/202501081) to open the `task1` page.
3. Please **log in** to the OpenBuild platform using your **GitHub account** to facilitate the subsequent statistical work.
4. Answer all the questions, take a screenshot of the result, and upload it to your `submissions/YourName/task1` folder.
5. Submit a Pull Request to this repository. Once your PR is merged, `task1` will be marked as complete.

Developers who complete all the courses and submit the tasks will receive a Level 1 Certification. If you earn all 4 Levels of Certifications in the future, you will be awarded a **Final Graduation Certificate** and become a priority candidate in our talent pool, gaining access to more job opportunities within the ecosystem.
